- 👋 Hi, This is 啟燊 (Mandarin: Qǐ Shēn; Cantonese: Kai2 San1). My English name used to be Oliver but I don't want to use it anymore since a Chinese should use his own chinese name.
- 👀 I’m interested in the therapeutic side of Biomedical Engineering: Gene Therapy, Human Machine Interface......You name it!
- 😋 I’m currently learning the computational biology in the field of protein engineering (Specifically for Cas9 proteins), I hope I can filter out the top variant among the high-throughput protein library with ddG
- 😋 I’m also currently learning the bioelectronics in the field of OECT sensor application (Specifically for biomedical wearables), I am constructing a communicational pipeline between PERfECT and other electronic terminals
- 💞️ I’m dreaming about the day that I can develop the implantable retinal prosthesis and other forms of bionic eyes (still a long long way to go)
- 😈 I love writing proses to record those marvellous and intriguing moments in my life (I have my own WeChat Official account to post my proses: CQS_CKS2001) and also love hikinig (I have hiked all the country parks in Hong Kong)
- 🔥 You can reach me via my email: u3556373@connect.hku.hk (Hope I can still use it after my graduation); or zenc2001@gmail.com (constantly use)
