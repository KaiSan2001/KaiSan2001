- 👋 Hi, This is 啟燊 (Mandarin: Qǐ Shēn; Cantonese: Kai2 San1). My English name used to be Oliver but I don't want to use it anymore since a Chinese should use his own chinese name.
- 👀 I’m interested in the therapeutic side of Biomedical Engineering: Gene Therapy, Human Machine Interface......You name it!
- 😋 I explored various research areas in the last year of my undergraduate journey. My Final Year Project related to the computational biology in the field of protein engineering (Specifically for Cas9 proteins), I filtered out top variants among the high-throughput protein library with ddG and even digged out some potential relationship between binding affinity and Cas9 fitness. I was also involved in the bioelectronics for some wearable applications, such as constructing a communicational pipeline between PERfECT and other electronic terminals, and increase the resolution of a wearable Ultrasound transducer via deep learning......
- 😋 I am currently pursuing my joint-master degrees in Johns Hopkins and Tsinghua University. Still with a BME label but do something more ECE...
- 💞️ I’m dreaming about the day that I can develop the implantable retinal prosthesis and other forms of bionic eyes (still a long long way to go)
- 😈 I love writing proses to record those marvellous and intriguing moments in my life (I have my own WeChat Official account to post my proses: CQS_CKS2001) and also love hikinig (I have hiked all the country parks in Hong Kong)
